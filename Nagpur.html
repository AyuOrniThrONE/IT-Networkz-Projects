	<h2> History </h2>
	<hr>
	<p>The city was founded in the early <b> 18th century </b> by Bakht Buland, a Gond raja. It became the capital of the Bhonsles of the Maratha confederacy but in 1817 came under British influence. In 1853 the city lapsed into British control and in 1861 became the capital of the Central Provinces. The advent of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway in 1867 spurred its development as a trade centre. After Indian independence, Nagpur was briefly the capital of Madhya Pradesh state, until 1956, when it was included in the newly formed Bombay state, and then in 1960 it became part of what is now Maharashtra state.</p>
